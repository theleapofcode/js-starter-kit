# js-starter-kit
Starter kit for JS project

## Editor
VSCode (https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the my choice because of the following features,
  1. Best JS code hinting features using intellisense.
  2. Supports rich set of plugins for almost anything.
  3. Built in terminal
  4. Built in Git UI
  5. Debugger

## EditorConfig
To maintain consistency of Editor configurations, use EditorConfig (http://editorconfig.org/). Install EditorConfig extension for VSCode (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfigTeam.EditorConfig). Add .editorconfig file at the project root.
