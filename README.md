Starter kit for JS project

## Editor
VSCode (https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my choice because of the following features,
  1. Best JS code hinting features using intellisense.
  2. Supports rich set of plugins for almost anything.
  3. Built in terminal
  4. Built in Git UI
  5. Debugger

### EditorConfig
To maintain consistency of Editor configurations, use EditorConfig (http://editorconfig.org/). Install EditorConfig extension for VSCode (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfigTeam.EditorConfig). Add .editorconfig file at the project root.


## Package Manager
NPM is the preferred manager for JS. It's not only for Node packages but also for front end packages.

### Node Security Platform
To check security vulnerability in npm packages.
