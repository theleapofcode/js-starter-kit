Starter kit for JS project

## Editor
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my choice because of the following features,
  1. Best JS code hinting features using intellisense.
  2. Supports rich set of plugins for almost anything.
  3. Built in terminal
  4. Built in Git UI
  5. Debugger

### EditorConfig
To maintain consistency of Editor configurations, use [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/). Install [EditorConfig extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfigTeam.EditorConfig). Add .editorconfig file at the project root.

## Package Manager
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is the preferred manager for JS. It's not only for Node packages but also for front end packages.

### Node Security Platform
[NSP](https://nodesecurity.io/) can be used to check for security vulnerabilities in npm packages.

## Development Server
[Express](http://expressjs.com/) is a good choice for a dev server since it is highly configurable and easy to use.

### Sharing Development Server
[LocalTunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/) can be used to share a development server over internet.

## Build Automation
[NPM Scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/) is the easiest option for automating build tasks. No need of Grunt or Gulp.

## Transpiling
[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is the best ES transpiler. Add .babelrc to configue babel transpiling options.
